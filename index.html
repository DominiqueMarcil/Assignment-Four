            And I stop remembering
            The days are just like moments turned to hours<br>
            Mother used to say
            If you want, you'll find a way
            But mother never danced through fire shower<br>
            Walk in the rain
            In the rain, in the rain
            I walk in the rain, in the rain<br>
            Is it right or is it wrong
            And is it here that I belong
            I don't hear a sound<br>
            Silent faces in the ground
            A quiet screams, but I refuse to listen
            If there is a hell<br>
            I'm sure this is how it smells
            Wish this were a dream, but no, it isn't
            Walk in the rain<br>
            In the rain, in the rain
            I walk in the rain, in the rain
            Am I right or am I wrong<br>
            And is it here that I belong
            Walk in the rain
            In the rain, in the rain<br>
            I walk in the rain, in the rain
            Why do I feel so alone
            For some reason I think of home</div>
